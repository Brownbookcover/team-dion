Mike: You read about this guy they just arrested? 33 people!
- The "Killer Clown" guy?
	Mike: The "Killer Clown" guy! Can you believe it? Guy was a clown, would offer you a magic trick, lure you to his home and BAM! Lights out, buddy.
	- That's gruesome.
		Mike: Not for the faint of heart, I guess.
	- That's awesome!
		Mike: I know!
- No.
	Mike: You gotta!
Mike: Lemme tell ya, if this guy was running around these streets, we'd all be dead by daylight!
